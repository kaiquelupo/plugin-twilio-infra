This plugin adds the `infra` command to the [Twilio CLI](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-cli). It integrates Pulumi with Twilio and consists of subcommands that let you create, deploy, and manage Twilio infrastructure via code.

## Requirements

### Install the Pulumi CLI

To get started with the Pulumi CLI, check out the [Download and Install page](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/).

Also, you need a backend storage system to keep your infrastructure state. The options are:

- The Pulumi Service backend
- A self-managed backend, either stored locally on your filesystem or remotely using a cloud storage service

See [State and Backends](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/concepts/state/#state-and-backends) for more details.

For quick testing, you can easily create a free Pulumi account and run `pulumi login` to your storage backend.

### Install the Twilio CLI

Via `npm` or `yarn`:

```sh-session
$ npm install -g twilio-cli
$ yarn global add twilio-cli
```

Via `homebrew`:

```sh-session
$ brew tap twilio/brew && brew install twilio
```

## Link the Twilio CLI Infra Plugin

To get started, run `npm install` to install the plugin package dependencies. Afterwards, run the following command:

```sh-session
$ twilio plugins:install plugin-twilio-infra
```

You can now start using the `twilio infra` commands on your machine.

## Usage

```sh-session
$ twilio infra --help
USAGE
  $ twilio infra
...
```

## Commands

<!-- commands -->
* `twilio infra:new`: Creates a new project using Pulumi provider
* `twilio infra:deploy`: Deploys and updates resources described in this directory to a Twilio project. Additional environment variables can be defined using `.env` files
* `twilio infra:preview`: Previews changes without deploying them to your Twilio project
* `twilio infra:destroy`: Destroy deployed resources associated to a specific environment
* `twilio infra:environment:new`: Create a new environment for the current Twilio project
* `twilio infra:environment:set`: Get the deployment environment set for the current project
* `twilio infra:environment:get`: Set the deployment environment for the current project

To see the usage details and options for each subcommand, run `twilio infra:<subcommand> --help`.

## Environment variables

Environment variables used by the `infra` commands can be stored in a `.env` file. Each _deployment environment_ can have its own file. The `env` file needs to be placed in the directory where the infra command is executed and needs to use the following naming convention:
```
.env.<environment name>
```
For example, if your environment is called `dev` the file needs to be called: 
```
.env.dev
```
`.env` file without suffix will not be loaded automatically by the CLI plugin.
